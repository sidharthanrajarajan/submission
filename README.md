1. Domain
- Designed **clean, encapsulated domain entities**:
  - `User`, `Role`, `Permission`, `Bank`, `Branch`, `Account`, `Transaction`
- Implemented **`BaseEntity`** with common audit fields.
- Added **value objects** and navigation properties for EF Core relationships.

---

 2. Infrastructure
- Configured **EF Core** with schema separation:
  - Default schema: `training`
  - Migration table moved under `training.__EFMigrationsHistory`
- Created **`ApplicationDbContext`** with full entity mapping.
- Added **Repository Pattern** support and dependency injection setup in `DependencyInjection.cs`.

---

3. Authentication
- Implemented **JWT Authentication using RSA (RS256)**:
  - Generates and validates **access tokens** and **refresh tokens**.
  - Configured via `JwtSettings` in `appsettings.json`:
    ```json
    "JwtSettings": {
      "Issuer": "UAMS",
      "Audience": "UAMSClient",
      "PrivateKeyPath": "Keys/private.key",
      "PublicKeyPath": "Keys/public.key",
      "AccessTokenExpirationMinutes": 30,
      "RefreshTokenExpirationDays": 7
    }
    ```
- `JwtTokenService` handles private key loading, token generation, and validation.
- Integrated with `UserManager<ApplicationUser>` for ASP.NET Identity.

---

4. Exception Handling
- Implemented **global exception middleware** to handle:
  - Validation errors
  - Unauthorized access
  - Database or application-level exceptions
- Returns structured JSON error responses:
  ```json
  {
    "statusCode": 400,
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "errors": [ ... ]
  }
5. Authorization (in progress)
Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Roles and permissions are persisted in the database.

UserSeeder seeds default admin and roles at startup
