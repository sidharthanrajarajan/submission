Solution Structure

UAMS.API → The main web API project.

Controllers – Handle incoming API requests (e.g., AccountsController).

Keys – Folder with RSA public/private key files used for JWT authentication.

Program.cs / Startup.cs – Sets up Identity, JWT authentication, EF Core, and Swagger.

UAMS.Domain → Holds the main business models.

Entities like User, Role, Account, Transaction, etc.

Contains base classes for auditing and soft delete.

UAMS.Application → The middle layer (currently empty).

Used for business logic, commands, queries, DTOs, and validation later.

UAMS.Infrastructure → Handles actual data and technical details.

Data/ → ApplicationDbContext for Identity (user logins, roles).

Persistence/ → UamsDbContext for business data (accounts, transactions).

Identity/ → ApplicationUser, JWT setup, token generation.

Seed/ → Adds default roles and users.

Migrations/ → Database migrations for Identity.

How the Folder Structure Can Be Improved

Application Layer

Add folders for Commands, Queries, DTOs, Interfaces, and Validators.

This will separate business logic from controllers and keep the code organized.

Infrastructure Layer

Group related code more clearly, for example:

Data/ → EF Core contexts and configurations

Identity/ → User, Role, and JWT setup

Services/ → Common utilities like email, logging, and auditing

Migrations/ → Separate folders for each DbContext (Identity and Business)

Domain Layer

Keep only business entities, enums, and domain rules here.

Avoid putting EF Core or external dependencies in this layer.

API Layer

Use folders like Controllers/, Models/, Filters/, and Middlewares/.

Keep it focused on handling requests and responses.

Solution Level

Consider adding a Tests/ project for unit and integration tests.

Optionally add a Docs/ folder for documentation or diagrams.
