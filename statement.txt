Problem Statement â€“ User and Account Management System (UAMS)

The goal is to build a system to manage users, their roles, login access, and bank related information like customers, employees, and accounts. 

The system will use JWT authentication with RS256 (private and public keys). It will issue both access and refresh tokens and control access using roles (RBAC).

What the system should do:
1. Let users register and log in (admins, bank employees, customers).
2. Use JWT tokens signed with RS256 for login sessions.
3. Provide refresh tokens along with access tokens.
4. Control what users can do based on their roles.
5. Store and manage roles and permissions.
6. Keep details about banks and their branches.
7. Link employees and customers to their bank and branch.
8. Track when data was created or updated.
9. Support token refresh and revocation.
10. Keep the database structured and easy to expand.

Other things the system should take care of:
1. Passwords must be stored securely (hashed maybe Base64?).
2. Tokens must expire and be verified using the public key.
3. Each role should only allow specific actions.
4. The system should be easy to grow (future enchancemeents).
5. Emails and usernames should be unique.
6. Database should have proper relationships and foreign keys.
7. Work as a REST API using ASP.NET Core.
8. Handle errors and inputs properly.
9. Use UTC time for all timestamps.
